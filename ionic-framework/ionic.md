## Introduction

Ionic framework is a hybrid mobile app framework. With Ionic framework, 
HTML5 and AngularJS are the two main skills required to develop 
cross-platform mobile apps.

Ionic framework website has a pretty easy getting-started guide. Following 
this [guide](http://ionicframework.com/getting-started/) is enough to get 
 an app up and running. 
 
 Note that emulating Android device or run on a real Android device 
 would require installation of Android SDK/Studio, along with a bunch of 
 Android APIs and platform tools, as well as Google USB Driver, or 
 a custom driver that would enable deploying to an Android device via USB
 connection. Alternatively, a compiled (built) .apk file can be transfer 
 to a Android device by other method, and installed directly (with phone system 
 permission set properly).
